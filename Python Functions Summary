(*) VARIABLES

Here's a recap of everything we learned in this chapter:

    Data types: int, float, str, bool.
    Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /.
    The % modulo finds the remainder.
    The ** exponentiation finds the exponent.
    The input() function is used to get user input.
    The int() function converts a value into an integer number.

# Relational Operators

A lot of the times inside conditions, we are comparing two values. To do so, we need to use a different type of operators called relational operators that compares values:

    == equal to
    != not equal to
    > greater than
    < less than
    >= greater than or equal to
    <= less than or equal to
