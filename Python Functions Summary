(*) VARIABLES

Here's a recap of everything we learned in this chapter:

    Data types: int, float, str, bool.
    Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /.
    The % modulo finds the remainder.
    The ** exponentiation finds the exponent.
    The input() function is used to get user input.
    The int() function converts a value into an integer number.

# Relational Operators

A lot of the times inside conditions, we are comparing two values. To do so, we need to use a different type of operators called relational operators that compares values:

    == equal to
    != not equal to
    > greater than
    < less than
    >= greater than or equal to
    <= less than or equal to

Control flow is the order in which the program's code executes.
if statement tests a condition for truth and executes the code if it's True.
elif clause can be added between if and else.
else executes the code if none of the above is True.
Relational operators are used to compare two values: ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=.
Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions: and, or, not
